# Sprint: Main Content UX Improvement
**Date**: 2025-06-06  
**Goal**: Enhance user experience in the main content area with loading states, error handling, and visual feedback

## Overview
This sprint addresses critical UX issues in the main-content component:
- Users see blank screens during file loading
- No indication when files are being indexed
- Errors are silent with no user feedback
- Overall lack of visual feedback for user actions

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Loading States and Basic Feedback (2 hours)
**Goal**: Provide immediate visual feedback during file operations

#### Files to Modify:
1. **main-content.component.ts**
   - Add loading state management
   - Implement error state tracking
   - Add file operation status tracking

2. **main-content.component.html**
   - Add loading spinner overlay
   - Add error message display
   - Add status indicators

3. **main-content.component.scss**
   - Style loading states
   - Style error messages
   - Add smooth transitions

#### Success Criteria:
- [ ] Loading spinner appears during file load
- [ ] Error messages display when operations fail
- [ ] Smooth transitions between states
- [ ] No visual glitches or layout shifts

### Phase 2: Indexing Status Integration (2 hours)
**Goal**: Show indexing progress and prevent user confusion

#### Files to Create:
1. **indexing-state.service.ts**
   - Central service for indexing state management
   - Observable streams for progress updates
   - Integration with SignalR hub

#### Files to Modify:
1. **main-content.component.ts**
   - Subscribe to indexing state
   - Show indexing overlay when active
   - Disable certain actions during indexing

2. **sidenav.component.ts**
   - Show indexing indicators on folders
   - Update tree nodes with indexing status

3. **toolbar.component.ts**
   - Disable/enable buttons based on indexing state
   - Show global indexing progress

#### Success Criteria:
- [ ] Indexing progress visible to users
- [ ] Clear indication of which folders are being indexed
- [ ] Actions appropriately disabled during indexing
- [ ] No race conditions or state conflicts

### Phase 3: Enhanced Feedback and Polish (2 hours)
**Goal**: Add contextual help and improve overall polish

#### Files to Modify:
1. **main-content.component.html**
   - Add empty state with helpful actions
   - Add contextual tooltips
   - Improve accessibility

2. **main-content.component.ts**
   - Add recent files tracking
   - Implement smart suggestions
   - Add keyboard shortcuts

3. **styles.scss** (global)
   - Add consistent animation timing
   - Ensure dark mode compatibility
   - Add focus indicators

#### Success Criteria:
- [ ] Empty state provides clear next actions
- [ ] All interactive elements have tooltips
- [ ] Keyboard navigation works smoothly
- [ ] Dark mode looks polished

## Technical Implementation Details

### Loading State Management
```typescript
interface ContentState {
  isLoading: boolean;
  error: string | null;
  currentFile: string | null;
  isIndexing: boolean;
  indexingProgress: number;
}
```

### Error Handling Strategy
- Network errors: Show retry button
- File not found: Suggest similar files
- Permission errors: Provide help link
- Indexing conflicts: Queue operations

### Visual Design Guidelines
- Loading spinner: Material progress spinner, 48px
- Error colors: mat-warn palette
- Transitions: 200ms ease-in-out
- Overlay opacity: 0.7 for loading states

## Testing Plan

### Manual Testing Checklist:
1. **Loading States**
   - [ ] Open large file (>1MB)
   - [ ] Open file during indexing
   - [ ] Switch files rapidly
   - [ ] Test with slow network

2. **Error Scenarios**
   - [ ] Delete file while viewing
   - [ ] Corrupt file handling
   - [ ] Network disconnection
   - [ ] Permission denied

3. **Visual Consistency**
   - [ ] Test in Chrome, Firefox, Edge
   - [ ] Test responsive breakpoints
   - [ ] Test with different zoom levels
   - [ ] Test keyboard-only navigation

### Automated Testing:
- Unit tests for loading state logic
- Integration tests for error scenarios
- E2E tests for critical user flows

## Rollback Plan
If issues arise:
1. Revert main-content component changes
2. Keep indexing service (non-breaking)
3. Address issues in next sprint

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All success criteria met
- [ ] Code reviewed and approved
- [ ] Tests passing (unit, integration)
- [ ] No console errors or warnings
- [ ] Performance impact < 50ms
- [ ] Documentation updated

## Notes
- Coordinate with backend team on indexing status API
- Consider WebSocket connection for real-time updates
- Future enhancement: Progress persistence across sessions
